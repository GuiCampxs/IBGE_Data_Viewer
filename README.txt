Welcome to IBGE Data Viewer!

This code aims to collect data from the open IBGE API and present
it in a functional way in a simple web application.

How the application works:
The user (you) will open the .HTML file in a web browser. 
Select a region of Brazil and then choose the corresponding state for that region. 
The application will display all the cities in that particular federation. 
You can use the program to find all the cities in the country 
and which state belongs to each region.

Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework.

Note: To inspect the code you can open the application in a web browser and press F12. Or 
you can open the file with an IDE of your choice. The code was created in Visual Studio Code.
